Hummingbird is your early warning system for third-party service outages. We monitor your critical dependencies like website hosting, payment processors, and more, so you can address issues before they impact your customers.

## Why Hummingbird?

Unexpected downtime in services like Netlify, Auth0, Stripe, or Twilio can be disastrous:

- **Costly:** Downtime costs an average of $55,000 per hour.
- **Damaging:** 40% of disruptions harm your company's reputation.

Hummingbird gives you the visibility you need to keep your business running smoothly.
